           <h2>#1</h2>
           I've been on a long journey trying to work out how the brain works and why we act the way we do. I was specifically interested in how two people behave so differently in the same situation, and how we can change the brains wiring in order to become better in life so that we can have more fulfilling relationships, happier experiences and the ability to create an amazing future to live in to.</p>

This is why I wrote my book The Workbook to Happiness. It is a set of processes I learnt and developed over the years that have helped me grow from a scared individual to a fearless motivated happy person who mostly always gets what he wants in life.</p>

            <p>Part of this journey of discovery has also got me interested in the way many people seem to develop senility in later life. Statistically if you live till your 61st birthday then your life is likely to extend another 20 to 30 years, by which time most people will be diagnosed as senile. The changes that occur in the brain cause this ongoing atrophy. What most people don't know is that this is avoidable. We now know that we can stop this process and the best time to start is right now.</p>

             What most people don't realise is that they are the captain, and that they are in control of their brain and can tell it where to go and what to do. They don't see that they can change their brain functionally to be better than it ever was before. Of course being the captain of the ship they can also crash it in to the rocks which is what many people do because they haven't had the correct training on how to steer the ship in to calm waters and learn all the extra skills to keep the brain alert in to the twilight years.

             <p>Many people who go through life changing experiences often say "I did not know Is was capable of doing that". This is only down to the fact they have never dared to try. Fear holds us back from many things. Fear is easily tackled using simple but effective processes. Once fears are negated people have this incredible capacity to improve themselves. They become a waterfall of joy and abundance that cascades over all those that they come across. They touch and inspire others..</p>

             The most amazing things about brain plasticity is that the person you are has been created in your brain within your lifetime by billions of moments of change. About half of those moments come from your interaction with the outside world and the other half from you, they've come from mental actions and thoughts within the brain. You are a work in progress and you have the capacity to change, you have the capacity to be a a better stronger more effective person at any point in life and you should think about what you need to do to accomplish in this lifetime for it is still possible.

             <p>When I was travelling in Australia I met a woman as I exited the shower half naked in to the hostel dormitory. I was surprised at first as she looked quite old. I had never seen anyone so old in a hostel before. She told me she was travelling the world. When her husband passed away she decided she wanted to see the world. She was 83 years of age. Now she is one of the lucky ones with no fear, but she had to change her brain plasticity to get to that point..</p>

Wow! Your NLP skills are so very powerful… I am very impressed and now quite fancy learning more about NLP...

                      <p>I had a series of NLP sessions with Steve to work on reframing an attack which I had experienced PTSD from, working on some self limiting beliefs and also going through my timeline to distinguish uncomfortable emotions felt in my childhood. I found him to be very professional and he has a good ability to deliver concepts in a step by step process, making it understandable for those who haven't had NLP before. He made me feel safe and confident as a client to talk about how I felt and thus issues that I was dealing with. I would highly recommend him.</p> <img src="images/Pictures/joseph-kellner-EH6-hOhDqpA-unsplash.jpg" class="img-fluid">

                    <p>Steve is an incredibly generous and insightful coach, who makes you feel that he is on your side, whilst supporting you to have a life that you love. He can be tough or playful as required and has an instinctual understanding of what is needed in each situation. He recently coached me on a breakdown in a relationship, which had left me angry and hurt. As a result of his words, I felt instantly understood and was able to let go of the intensity of the emotions and to be compassionate towards this person. What was great was that he listened to me without adding to the drama or making any judgements about the person or situation.

Steve's personal skills are second to none, he made me feel at ease straight away and combining that with his skill for NLP its definitely worth giving it a go if you have things you need to work through.
